A.
The PUSH ESP instruction pushed the value of the ESP register as it existed before the instruction was executed. If a PUSH instruction uses a memory operand in which the ESP register is used for computing the operand address, the address of the operand is computed before the ESP register is decremented.

B.
movq REG, -8(%rsp)
subq $8, %rsp
