The main in bar6.c isn't initialized with a default value, so it is a weak type.
The main in foo6.c is a global function, it is a strong type.
The linker choose the strong type automatically.
The main as a parameter of printf() is the main in foo6.c.
But the printf() treat the main as a char, so the system get a char(one byte)
from the address of main().

<main>:
55          push %rbq
48 89 e5    mov %rsp, $rbq

0x55 means push %rbq
0x48 means mov
